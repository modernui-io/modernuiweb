      "Come 2021, Modern UI had expanded to over 40 locations. The brandâ€™s digital presence existed, but it lacked strategy. Although its target market of 21-30 year-olds was as engaged (and as loyal) as ever, the brand had outgrown its amateur look of the early '00s and the family-owned business vibes. It needed to show it was a strong brand moving in a new direction - and it was heading there fast.",
