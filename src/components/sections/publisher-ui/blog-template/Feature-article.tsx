        Getting started with ModernUI Web
      </Heading>
      <Text className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
        First of all you need to understand how ModernUI Web works. This library
        is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on
        Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.
      </Text>
      <Text className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
        It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components,
        such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you can optionally
        include into your project via CDN or NPM.
      </Text>
      <Text className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
        You can check out the quickstart guide to explore the elements by
        including the CDN files into your project. But if you want to build a
        project with ModernUI Web I recommend you to follow the build tools
        steps so that you can purge and minify the generated CSS.
      </Text>
      <Text className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
        You&#39;ll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI,
        and e-commerce pages that can help you get started with your projects
        even faster. You can check out this comparison table to better
        understand the differences between the open-source and pro version of
        ModernUI Web.

      <Text className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
        While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key
        moments in which prototyping will come in handy:
      </Text>
      <ol>
        <li className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
          <strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit
          out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy
          something from the site you&#39;ve designed? By running a usability
          test, you&#39;ll be able to see how users will interact with your
          design once it&#39;s live;
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
          <strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR
          consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to your
          data protection team and they can test it for real;
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
          <strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or
          even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on
          experience;
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
          <strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive
          medium to preview and test design elements, designers and developers
          can understand each other — and the project — better.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Laying the groundwork for best design

      <Text className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
        Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas
        in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before
        committing to an actual design project.

        Best practices for setting up your prototype
      </Heading>
      <Text className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
        <strong>Low fidelity or high fidelity?</strong> Fidelity refers to how
        close a prototype will be to the real deal. If you&#39;re simply
        preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity
        prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text
        — would be more than enough. But if you&#39;re going for more intricate
        usability testing, hi-fi prototypes are the better choice.
      </Text>
      <Text className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
        <strong>Anticipate technical issues</strong>. Consider the technical
        limitations of your prototype early. If you&#39;re using the prototype
        to pitch a product that will require real-world hardware, ensure the
        prototype will be easy to port to said hardware.
      </Text>
      <Text className="mb-4 md:text-lg">
        <strong>Remember accessibility</strong>. It&#39;s crucial to take into
        account accessibility concerns when creating a prototype. If it&#39;s a
        feature that will make navigation easier for users with disabilities,
        build it into your prototype. If you&#39;re creating a website for
        general consumption, ensure anyone can use it.
